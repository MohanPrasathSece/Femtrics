## Project Design & Impact Report

**Date:** December 24, 2024
**Project:** Femtrics Insights Hub

### 1. Problem Framing
Many women micro-entrepreneurs in India rely on manual bookkeeping or intuition, leading to unoptimized inventory, unknown profit margins, and slow growth. 

**Visual Visualization:**
> Using a hand-drawn sketch style, we contrast the chaotic "Before" state with the organized, data-driven "After" state.

### 2. Early System Concept
To solve this, we conceptualized a mobile-first philosophy that brings enterprise-level analytics to a simple, accessible interface.

**Concept Wireframe:**
> Early blueprint showing the simplified dashboard approach: Revenue at a glance + Actionable alerts (e.g., "Restock Silk Sarees").

### 3. Data Pipeline Architecture
How do we turn raw data into insights? The Femtrics Engine ingests data from multiple sources (Social Media, Excel, Manual Input), processes it through our AI models, and delivers actionable dashboards.
